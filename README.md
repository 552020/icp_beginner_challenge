## Pub-sub Reloaded

"PubSub Reloaded" focuses on inter-canister communication. It makes the scenario of the original demo app more meaningful, providing a context that beginners can understand by clearly defining roles and using a more intuitive message type.

## HTTPS Get Reloaded

This repository is a modified version of the HTTPS outcalls tutorial. The original tutorial used Coinbase Pro's API, which is no longer freely available. We've adapted the code to use Kraken's API instead, and incorporated JSON parsing using an external library to handle the different response format.

## Access Hello Reloaded

"Access Hello Reloaded" consists of a backend based on the **access_hello** app from section 3.6 of the Motoko Liftoff tutorial, which focuses on principals and caller identification. It primarily focuses on backend authentication and authorization. The frontend builds on the sample app from the [Integrating with Internet Identity guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/identity/internet-identity/integrate-internet-identity). The original project has been refactored from [Lit](https://lit.dev/) to React/Vite.
